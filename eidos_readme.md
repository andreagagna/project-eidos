# Eidos — Overview

**Eidos** is a study-and-creation path for mastering modern data engineering.  
It links readings → skills → artifacts, and keeps a public thread of thought.

- **Why**: To convert knowledge into elegant, testable systems.
- **How**: Curated readings, deliberate practice, and small composable repos.
- **When**: Multi-year horizon with quarterly reviews.

## Cadence
- 6h/week average (adjust as life requires)
- Review every 6 weeks; retrospective each quarter

## Artifacts
Keep them real and small: one clear problem, one clean solution, one README.
