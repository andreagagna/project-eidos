# Eidos — Overview

**Eidos** is a study-and-creation path for mastering modern data engineering.  
It links readings → skills → artifacts, and keeps a public thread of thought.

- **Why**: To convert knowledge into elegant, testable systems.
- **How**: Curated readings, deliberate practice, and small composable repos.
- **When**: Multi-year horizon with quarterly reviews.

## Cadence
- 6h/week average (adjust as life requires)
- Review every 6 weeks; retrospective each quarter

## Artifacts
Keep them real and small: one clear problem, one clean solution, one README.

## Rationale & Design of the Arc

Eidos favors **systems over tools, depth over novelty, and visible creation over passive learning**.

**Selection principles**
- Choose books that build interoperable mental models.
- Prefer timeless architectural foundations to transient stacks.
- Anchor each reading in a tangible artifact.

**Year-1 focus**
Foundations, flow, and first contact with scale.  
The aim is to forge habits (*The Pragmatic Programmer*, *Accelerate*), design pipelines (*Fundamentals*, *Kimball*), and touch distributed systems (*DDIA*, *Spark*, *Kafka*) without overreach.

**Exclusions**
Vendor-locked tutorials, obsolete Hadoop-era guides, and premature governance/mesh complexity.  
These return later, once the backbone exists.

> Year-1 is not everything — it is the skeleton on which future depth will grow.
