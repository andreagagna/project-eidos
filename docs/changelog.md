# Changelog — Project Eidos

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

---

## [2025-11-06] – Phase 1 · Conceptual Architecture

**Added**
- Defined the long-arc structure of *Project Eidos* (4 pillars, 3–4 year horizon).
- Established project goals: transform readings → skills → artifacts → portfolio.
- Defined core metrics (Importance, Relevance, Breadth, Effort, OPI).

**Rationale**
This phase translated an abstract aspiration into an operational blueprint.  
Eidos was defined not as a reading list but as an evolving ecosystem for mastery, integrating intellect, creation, and documentation.

**Outcome**
A complete Phase 1 plan describing knowledge pillars, quantitative metrics, and the principle of *visible proof* through GitHub artifacts.

## [2025-11-06] – Phase 2 · Year-1 Roadmap

**Added**
- Constructed the Year-1 timeline (Q1–Q4) with ~7 books, 3 core artifacts, and 6-week review cadence.
- Established alignment with *GaiaFlow* project for artifact synergy.
- Defined success metrics (books completed, artifacts produced, cadence adherence).

**Rationale**
Anchored the first operational cycle: balancing craft, systems, and distributed processing while embedding Hofstadter’s Law for realistic pacing.

**Outcome**
A practical 12-month plan ready for YAML integration and review scheduling.

## [2025-11-06] – Phase 3 · Repository Scaffold

**Added**
- Created full `project-eidos/` repo structure with placeholders.
- Added poetic `README.md` introduction.
- Implemented `growth_tracker.py` (CLI for reading plan summary and listing books).
- Initialized empty `data_engineering_growth_plan.yaml` with schema and placeholders.
- Added documentation folder with templates (`eidos_readme.md`, `year1_plan.md`, `review_template.md`).

**Rationale**
Materialized the conceptual architecture as a living repository.  
The poetic tone affirms that Eidos unites engineering precision with aesthetic presence.

**Outcome**
A clean, version-controlled scaffold ready for Year-1 population.

## [2025-11-06] – Phase 3b · Year-1 Population

**Added**
- Populated `data_engineering_growth_plan.yaml` with Year-1 books, artifacts, metrics, and review cadence.
- Generated detailed `year1_plan.md` with dates, quarterly objectives, and outputs.
- Bundled initialization ZIP for local push to GitHub.

**Rationale**
Transitioned Eidos from skeleton to heartbeat — the plan became executable.  
Metrics, timeframes, and deliverables now form a coherent system of learning and creation.

**Outcome**
Year-1 plan operationalized; repository fully initialized and ready for tracking.

## [2025-11-06] – Phase 4 · Reflection & Coherence

**Added**
- Performed alignment audit of global→quarter→book timelines (temporal coherence check).
- Confirmed validity of Option A (mixed year: foundations + systems + distributed).
- Added rationale sections to `eidos_readme.md` and `year1_plan.md`.
- Introduced this changelog to capture the project’s living evolution.

**Rationale**
This reflection phase transforms planning into philosophy.  
Eidos is now self-documenting: its choices are explicit, its logic transparent.

**Outcome**
Chronological trace of every phase; repository now fully narrates its own emergence.

---

## [TBD] – Phase 5 · Execution Environment & Companion Tools

**Planned**
- Establish shared local environment (Python + Jupyter + Spark/Kafka lightweight setup).
- Automate YAML → Markdown rendering (progress dashboards, reports).
- Integrate `growth_tracker.py` with minimal web or notebook interface.
- Add environment setup guide (`docs/setup_guide.md`).

**Intent**
To transform Eidos from a documentation framework into an *active learning environment*.  
Phase 5 will bridge static planning and dynamic execution — allowing readings, metrics,
and artifacts to evolve together through live tooling.

**Expected Outcome**
A reproducible, self-tracking workspace supporting the next years of development and reflection.
